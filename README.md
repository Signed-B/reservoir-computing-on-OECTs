## Abstract

We present a theoretical framework for simulating reservoir computers using organic electrochem-
ical transistors (OECTs) as the non-linear units. As it is time-consuming and expensive to build
large numbers of OECTs, we use our framework to predict the performance of different architec-
tures to explore the state space of hyperparameters and to optimize the reservoir topology given a
set of OECTs with given operating parameters. We find that our model accurately captures the
qualitative behavior of the transient dynamics of an OECT with a time-varying input signal.
